## Fix top gradient banding on scroll-under-header pages

Fix visible horizontal bands (3-band effect) at the top of Notifications, Trips, Top Species, Field Guide, and other pages that use `scrollContentUnderHeader` or similar layouts.

### Root cause

Introduced in commit **9033143** ("Home stats centering, blue sheet scale, and chrome polish", 2026-07-01). That commit added both `LogbookTopChromeScrim` to `AppPage.scrollUnderHeaderBody` AND `AppStatusBarEdgeScrim` to `CollapsibleInlineTitleHeader` in the same change, creating a double-scrim when these components are used together.

### Bug fix

- Two semi-transparent scrims were stacked: `LogbookTopChromeScrim` from `AppPage.scrollUnderHeaderBody` (or Field Guide's manual layout), plus `AppStatusBarEdgeScrim` from `CollapsibleInlineTitleHeader` or `AppHeader`. The overlapping gradients at different opacity curves created visible banding.
- Added `statusBarScrimIsProvidedExternally` parameter to `CollapsibleInlineTitleHeader`, `AppHeader`, and related chrome components. When `true`, the component skips rendering its own `AppStatusBarEdgeScrim`, avoiding the double-scrim.
- `AppPage.scrollUnderHeaderBody` now passes `statusBarScrimIsProvidedExternally: true` since it already renders `LogbookTopChromeScrim`.
- Field Guide, Logbook, and category browse chrome components default to `true` since their parents also render the tall scrim.

### Affected screens

- Notifications (`HomeNotificationsView`)
- Trips (`TripPlannerView`)
- Top Species / Deepest / Longest / Top Sites (`HomeLifetimeStatsLeaderboardView`)
- Field Guide hub and category/subcategory browse
- Logbook (`LogbookCollapsibleHeader`)
- All `AppPage` users with `scrollContentUnderHeader: true`

### Not changed

- Home (`BlueSheetHomeTopChrome`) — was on the do-not-regress list and not reported; keeping both scrims preserves status-bar legibility over hero photos/videos.
- `ExploreTopChrome` and `ExploreMapTopChromeScrim` — Explore uses `AppStatusBarEdgeScrim` directly (not through shared headers), so it continues to work as before.
- `BlueSheetDetailTopChrome`, `profile.swift`, `friend_profile_view.swift` — these use `.detailTop` fade style which renders `EmptyView()`, so no double scrim.
- Global search — custom chrome components, unchanged.

Fixes #15.
